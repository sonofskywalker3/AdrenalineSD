- What is Adrenaline? -
  Adrenaline is a software that modifies the official PSP Emulator using taiHEN CFW framework
  to make it run a PSP 6.61 custom firmware. Thanks to the power of taiHEN, Adrenaline can
  inject custom code into the IPL which allows unsigned code to run at boottime.
  
- IMPORTANT NOTE -
  For 6.61 Adrenaline-2 or higher, you must put Adrenaline files to 'ux0:adrenaline' instead of 'ux0:pspemu/adrenaline'.
  
- Network update -
  For 6.61 Adrenaline-4 or higher, you can use the 'System Update' in the XMB to update Adrenaline to the latest version.
  1) Choose 'System Update' in XMB, then click 'Update via Internet'.
  2) If a connection name does already exist, skip to 5).
  3) Otherwise select '[New Connection]', then 'Enter Manually', press RIGHT three times until you need to enter a connection name.
  4) Type any connection name and press RIGHT two times. You'll now see the message 'Press the X/O button to save settings'.
  5) Press X/O on any connection name.
  6) Follow the instructions to update Adrenaline.

        ux0:adrenaline/adrenaline.skprx

        *TITLEID
        ux0:adrenaline/adrenaline.suprx

    Example of config.txt:

        *KERNEL
